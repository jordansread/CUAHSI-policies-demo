## Supervisor Expectations

The direct supervisor for a new hire is responsible for ensuring a successful onboarding experience. This includes completing the tasks in this document, arriving on time to welcome the employee on the first day (or arranging – ahead of time – for someone else to), and being available to resolve any issues during the onboarding process (or arranging – ahead of time – for someone else to).  

A position description should be given to the new hire at the time of onboarding and the supervisor should complete a performance plan within one month of the new hire starting. 

## Employment documents  

Employment documents should be requested from HR Knowledge (hr@cuahsi.org).  (Tonja can also assist with this effort). HR Knowledge will need the new hire’s application materials (i.e. resume) and email address. Then, new hire paperwork will be sent to the new hire’s email address. This will include items like I-9 Employment Verification, Direct Deposit, Insurance Enrollment, etc., as applicable for the employee type (i.e. full-time versus part-time).  

### CUAHSI documents 

The new hire is required to sign off on the CUAHSI Employee Handbook, which documents at major HR-related policies and procedures.  


### Account setup and access 

As soon as a new hire accepts an offer, the supervisor should send a request to setup an O365 account to Martin. The new hire will also need a CUAHSI email address created, (Martin) and added to all applicable CUAHSI email distribution lists. (Martin or Summer) 

The supervisor should also advise the new hire on: 

 - CUAHSI standards for email font & signature 
 - Connecting to and how to use Shared Calendars 
 - Connecting to and how to use Timesheets & ADP 
 - Setting up and accessing Vonage (phone and online) 
 - Connecting to SharePoint and Google Drive guidance 

## Equipment & Other Materials 

Applicable equipment, such as a computer, monitors, and docking station, should be procured by the direct supervisor ahead of the new hire’s arrival, if possible. These items should be inventoried and communicated to Martin. 

On the new hire’s first day, they should send their name, title, and email address to Lisa to create business cards.  

## Training on Company Procedures 

As applicable to the new hire’s position, the supervisor needs to train a new hire on the following procedures: 

 - Travel Policies 
 - Zoom & Teams Procedures 
 - Meeting Invitation and Agenda Etiquette
 - Submitting announcements to communications team for distribution 

## CUAHSI Orientation 

During the first week, the supervisor should provide an overview of CUAHSI to the new hire. This can include briefing the new hire with slides (or arranging for someone else to), providing the new hire with introductory materials for them to review, and introducing the new hire to other staff members. 

## 90-Day Review 

Around 90 days into a new hire’s tenure at CUAHSI, the direct supervisor should provide an (at least informal) assessment that addresses the new hire’s performance compared to the expectations of the position.
