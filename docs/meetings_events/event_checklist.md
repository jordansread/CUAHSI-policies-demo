Initial Stakeholder meeting checklist 

**_Document purpose and use_**: When planning an event with eternal stakeholders, expectations, roles, and deadlines must be set early in the process. Use this checklist at an initial stakeholder meeting to establish answers to the following essential questions to move forward with a shared understanding of the necessary work. The answers to these questions can change and evolve throughout the event planning process, but these initial answers are an important starting point. Fill in the information that you already know before the meeting so you can make sure there is shared understanding. 

NOTE: At the end of this document is the ROLES section. Do not conclude the stakeholder meeting without going over this section.
