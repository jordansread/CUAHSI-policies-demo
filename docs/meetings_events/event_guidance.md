**Purpose and Use**: This document is for use by CUAHSI staff for planning in-person events with anticipated attendance of 100 people or more. Use this as a guide for initial planning and considerations, and the included timeline to plan and allocate work in the months leading up to the event

### 1. Initial Meeting Ideation

 - Review past events to reuse relevant information/tools 
    - Ex: registration formats/platforms, previous feedback and lessons learned  
 - If this is a co-hosted meeting, secure partner organization or reach out to known partner organization.  
 - Establish internal billing allocation 
    - Establish whether meeting number under larger grant is needed 

### 2. Planning the Meeting  
Once the event is approved, set up an initial call with the planning committee to answer high level questions such as those listed below and determine roles and responsibilities. Hold an initial stakeholder meeting to review expectations and establish frequency of meetings with stakeholders/planning members. Use [this checklist.](event_checklist.md)

**Meeting Information**
 - Establish CUAHSI staff roles, other stakeholder roles

 - Identify lodging and meals per diem for meeting location 
 - Budget spend/allocation can be drafted using known variables, referring to pervious examples, templates, and advice from others.  
 - Budget is subject to change at the discretion of event/CUAHSI leadership, ensure the budget is known to planners at the start of event by confirming with leadership 
 - Determine if the event will have a registration fee to recoup event costs 
 - Final budget spend/allocation should be approved by supervisors  

**Visting Speakers & Visiting Conveners**

### 3. Implementation

**Setting Registration Fee (if applicable)**
 - Budget is initially created by first compiling all meeting costs (see event details above)  
 - In some cases, NSF funds in meeting costs category are applied to subsidize cost of meeting 
 - Registration fees can be set in a number of ways that differ based on event size and funding source as well as other factors.  
 
**Travel Grants/Financial Support to Attendees**
Travel Grants are often available to help defray the cost of travel to the event. With input from leadership establish how funds will be prioritized and distributed well ahead of time. This type of support is often “participant support” which may limit how the funds are distributed or used, but this should be verified by the program organizer. If you are not familiar with onboarding and reimbursing external travelers, consider looping in additional CUAHSI staff.  

 - A few common eligibility recommendations are listed below. 
    - Graduate Students and Post-Docs **affiliated with U.S. Institutions** are eligible for travel grants; preference is given to graduate students. 
    - **Local Attendees** (any individual who resides within 50 miles of the event) are not eligible for travel support or on-site meal support.
 - Grants allocation differs between events, but participants must register and, in many cases, participate (i.e., present a poster) to receive support. 
 - Ideally support is paid directly by CUAHSI to prevent the need for vendor onboarding and reimbursement. For example, paying for multiple hotel rooms with a CUAHSI debit card. 
 - If reimbursing, funds are issued as a reimbursement after the participant’s completion of the event (MUST attend the event to receive reimbursement. If a participant does not attend, they cannot claim the funds).  
 - The limitation of the funds should be determined and outlined early in the planning process and may depend on the funding structure.  
 - Travel must adhere to [CUAHSI’s travel policy](https://www.cuahsi.org/about/travel-policy)  
 - If needed, ask accounting for a meeting number to identify funds related to this event.
 - Once all travel grants are reserved or by a determined date that is communicated, request approval for Travel Authorizations through the appropriate form.  
    - [Non-employee travel authorization form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=erwBzeXb90CxXyF_o2jwUiuGl13aO9BIppYbKyqZZZ1UQVBGUE81WDNEMFJPUUpKSkU5MlFPWUZFUi4u) (to be filled out by staff member) 
    
### 4. Policies

**Refund Policy**
The refund policy should be determined by the project group prior to opening registration, while the budget and registration price is being set. Refunds may be given in the event of an emergency or other justifiable circumstance. Documentation must be reviewed by the Executive Director and in some cases the Board of Directors.  

**Waitlist**
A Waitlist is activated once registration closes on the registration platform of choice whether the event has reached capacity, or the registration deadline has passed. A person on the Waitlist is only to be contacted if a spot becomes available. When a spot is available, people are contacted in the order they signed up for the Waitlist. They are given two days to register for the event. After two days, the spot is offered to the next Waitlist person. 

**Code of Conduct**
All participants must be made aware of and agree to the [CUAHSI code of conduct](https://cuahsi.jotform.com/221455012596150) at the time of registration for the event.
