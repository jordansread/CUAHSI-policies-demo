## Traveler Reimbursement Process Guide

### 1. Understand Your Traveler
Before initiating the reimbursement process, ensure you have all the necessary information about the traveler and their trip.

 - Traveler Type: Employee or non-employee? (Different forms may be required)
 - Travel Dates & Location: Ensure travel aligns with approved dates and budget.
 - Funding Source: The grant or project account this trip will be billed to
 - Provided Meals: Determine if any meals are covered by the event or host to exclude from [per diem](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-results) calculations
 - Special Approvals Needed:
    - Rental car authorization
    - Travel outside of approved dates
    - Back-to-back CUAHSI-related/funded travel

### 2. Obtaining Travel Authorization 

 - For CUAHSI employee travel, use the [Employee Travel Form](https://forms.office.com/r/5pWsaDCzmd)
 - For any other (non-employee travel), use the [Non-Employee Travel Form](https://forms.office.com/r/UDyLLzhexi)
    - Traveler type will be participant or non-participant. _A participant is an individual who is receiving a service or training opportunity from a workshop, conference, seminar, symposium or other short-term instructional or information sharing activity._
    
These forms are routed to managers for approval. After manager approval, an email will be sent to the individual requesting the travel authorization. This email will contain a summary of the approved trip along with the travel number, which is a unique code that indentifies this specific trip and reimbursement (this number is important for accounting as well).

### 3. Vendor Onboarding (For New Non-Employee Travelers)
If the traveler is not onboarded as a vendor, complete the vendor onboarding process as described in [Vendor Onboarding](reimbursement/vendor_onboarding.md)

After the traveler submits onboarding documents, confirm [onboarding status](https://hydrologicscience.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Administration/EdIqT0WAjEtBu64lEZO4XCQBEI744ArSSRC2dCJgjjk-XA?e=SkWAN4) (<- _note this is likely outdated and needs to be changed as a process_)

If the traveler is not listed, check the [Vendor Onboarding Queue](https://hydrologicscience.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Administration/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD92409DA-C9C9-48C3-99FB-FFFE4831B6E8%7D&file=2024_vendor_onboarding_queue.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) for pending submissions. If your traveler is missing from the queue, you may need to nudge them to submit documents. 
If needed, follow up with Laura or the traveler.
